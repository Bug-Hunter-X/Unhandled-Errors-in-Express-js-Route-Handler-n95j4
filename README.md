# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that lacks proper handling for invalid input and potential database errors, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially exposing sensitive information.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, showcasing best practices for robust Express.js applications.

## Bug Description

The original code attempts to retrieve a user based on their ID. However, it fails to handle scenarios such as:

* **Invalid user ID:** If the ID is not a valid number, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing the `find` method to fail silently. 
* **User not found:** When no user matches the ID, a generic 'User not found' message is sent, lacking detail that could aid in debugging.
* **Database errors:** No handling for database query failures, network issues, etc.

## Solution

The solution includes:

* **Input validation:** Verifying the user ID is a number.
* **Specific error handling:** Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) with informative error messages.
* **Centralized error handling (middleware):**  This is shown as an improvement, allowing for more structured error management.
